# The Gossip Project

## Introduction

This project is part of an exercise from **The Hacking Project** bootcamp.

We're laying the groundwork for our future billion-dollar social media app â€” **The Gossip Project**. This Rails application simulates a social platform where users can post gossip (or *"potins"*), tag them, comment, like, and even message each other. The primary goal is to understand complex data modeling and relationships in a real-world context.
