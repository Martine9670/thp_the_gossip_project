# FreeDoc - Book Your Doctor

## Introduction

This project is an exercise from **The Hacking Project** bootcamp.

The goal is to implement a simplified version of Doctolib, the medical appointment booking platform, to understand how to model real-life relationships in a Rails application using ActiveRecord. The focus is on creating the appropriate models, setting up associations, and working with database records through the Rails console.



Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
    - Ruby 3.2.x (or compatible)
    - Rails 8.x

* System dependencies
    - PostgreSQL or SQLite (depending on configuration)
    - Node.js and Yarn (for managing assets, if needed)
    - Bundler (`gem install bundler`)


* Configuration
    - Clone the project and install the required gems

* Database creation
    - rails db:create
    - rails db:migrate
    - rails db:seed

* Database initialization
    - rails console
